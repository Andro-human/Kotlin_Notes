Types of collections 

1) List -> * Represents an ordered list of elements
	     * You can use same values multiple times
	     * Order of elements is preserved

2) Set -> * Represents an unordered list of elements without duplicates
	    * You can find elements faster 

3) Map -> * A collection of key-value pairs
	    * Keys are unique with exactly one value (values can be duplicates)
	    * Useful for storing logical connections between objects (for ex. an employee id and their position)


Collections in kotlin are read only by default. However you can always make a copy with fewer or additional elements


* mutableList -> Object which can change internally (without the need of copying it)
